"Meow" is a "very easy" starting-point machine on the cybersecurity training platform Hack The Box (HTB), designed to introduce beginners to basic penetration testing skills.

## Enumeration

We start with a port scanning. We detect port 23 open.
```python
❯ nmap 10.129.107.8
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-11-26 20:22 -03
Nmap scan report for 10.129.107.8 (10.129.107.8)
Host is up (0.22s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
23/tcp open  telnet

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.95 seconds
```

We do a quick google search and find:

> Port 23 is the default TCP port for Telnet, which allows you to connect to other devices remotely. Due to its lack of security, Telnet’s use has largely been superseded by SSH.

When we wannt to connect to port 23, we are asked for a password. 
```
❯ telnet 10.129.107.8
Trying 10.129.107.8...
Connected to 10.129.107.8.

## Foothold

It is common for users to use credentials that are easy to guess, such as: admin:admin, root:root, administrator:administrator o a username and a blank password.

```
❯ telnet 10.129.124.209
Trying 10.129.124.209...
Connected to 10.129.124.209.
Escape character is '^]'.

In this case the credentials are only user root. And in this way we gain access and found the flag.
